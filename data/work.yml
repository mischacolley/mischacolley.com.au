  summary: "I spent 11 months at <a href='http://www.brandnewmedia.global/' target='_blank'>Brand New Media</a> working as the Front-End Developer on this Ruby on Rails project and 3 other related web properties. My focus was on responsive design, performance and authoring modular interfaces with Haml, Sass and CoffeeScript. This was a remote position on a distributed team requiring collaboration via Git, self direction and a proactive approach to task completion."

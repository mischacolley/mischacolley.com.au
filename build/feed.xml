    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap. Some love it. Some hate it. Who cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been far too many posts written about the pros and cons of Bootstrap. This isn't one of them. This post started its life because I couldn't find a good reference point for the mixins needed to build layouts without adding grid classes to your markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few tutorials out there but no easy Sass reference I could use and point my team to so I made a &lt;a href="http://codepen.io/mischacolley/pen/bdeoop"&gt;pen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-height="268" data-theme-id="14405" data-slug-hash="bdeoop" data-default-tab="result" data-user="mischacolley" class="codepen"&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href="http://codepen.io/mischacolley/pen/bdeoop/"&gt;Bootstrap Sass grid Mixin examples&lt;/a&gt; by Mischa Colley (&lt;a href="http://codepen.io/mischacolley"&gt;@mischacolley&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href="http://codepen.io"&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This may become obsolete for new projects when &lt;a href="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/"&gt;Bootstrap moves to Sass in version 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dont-be-a-hater"&gt;Don't be a Hater&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing this reference got me thinking about all the Bootstrap love and hate and basically how pointless it is. Don't get me wrong, Bootstrap has a time and a place. But if you are a professional developer you will find yourself deep within it at some point. Unless it's a personal project, how you feel about it probably won't matter. Don't be a hater, just get the job done and do it well. To do that you need to know everything about it. Make it yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="where-problems-start"&gt;Where Problems Start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've worked with Bootstrap on both large and small scale projects and &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; hasn't been the problem. The problems I have encountered have been related to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team members (myself included) having insufficient understanding of the complete Framework&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Differing stakeholder priorities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time constraints&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Misuse of &lt;a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities"&gt;Responsive Utilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insufficient separation of Markup and Styles. This is normally the biggie and the origins of this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="its-not-all-or-nothing"&gt;It's Not All or Nothing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important thing to remember is just because you are using Bootstrap doesn't mean you have to use all off it and only it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Zurb have a better &lt;a href="http://zurb.com/playground/responsive-tables"&gt;responsive tables solution&lt;/a&gt; so I often use that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the time and budget heed your better judgment and refrain from hiding vast swathes of your site on mobiles with &lt;a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities"&gt;.hidden-xs&lt;/a&gt; and so on. The Bootstrap docs even warn about this. Try to use these on a limited basis and avoid creating entirely different versions of the same site. Instead, use them to complement each devices presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="make-bootstrap-yours"&gt;Make Bootstrap Yours&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good developer should know how to customize Bootstrap to your needs and that of the project. With an experienced and well balanced design and development team it should just become another tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get to know &lt;a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/tree/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap"&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specifically the &lt;a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss"&gt;variables partial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I setup my Sass directory structure something like below (Rails) so I can customise and override to my harts content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Load custom overrides for Bootstrap variables and mixins */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./public/bootstrap/variables"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./public/bootstrap/mixins/**/*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Load Bootstrap Defaults. */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"bootstrap/mixins"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"bootstrap/variables"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./public/bootstrap/**/*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./public/base/**/*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'./public/components/**/*'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'./public/views/**/*'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id="decouple-your-markup--styles"&gt;Decouple your Markup &amp;amp; StylesÂ &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few tutorials out there but the Bootstrap docs themselves don't do a great job at advocating a separation of markup and styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commonly used prebuilt grid classes might serve you well on smaller projects but on larger ones insufficient separation of markup and styles can cause real issues. Trust me. I've been there, it isn't pretty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not inherently a problem with Bootstrap, it's a problem with your implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grid systems like &lt;a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/"&gt;Bourbon Neat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/"&gt;Susy&lt;/a&gt; have long used Mixins to define layout in css rather then with presentational classes. You can easily work with Bootstrap this way too. Just refer to my &lt;a href="http://codepen.io/mischacolley/pen/bdeoop"&gt;pen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tiny-bootstraps-for-every-clienthttpdaverupertcom201304responsive-deliverablestargetblank"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/"&gt;Tiny Bootstraps, for Every Client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you customize Bootstrap enough, eventually you might find that you start to develop a reusable codebase. One that takes the best Bootstrap has to offer but leaves out all the junk.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In early 2013 I interviewed at &lt;a href="http://www.orangedigital.com.au"&gt;Orange Digital&lt;/a&gt; and soon after began working there part time. Sandra and I were recently back from four and a half months in Europe and I was struggling to get myself reengaged with uni. I'd all but decided I was dropping out when we left to go traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days I was freelancing on the side and still working hospitality on the weekends but part-time quickly turned to full-time and then I never enrolled for my next semester. I was having a great time earning and learning in the industry again..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent almost 2 years at Orange building awesome sites and mobile apps with a fantastic team of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started at Orange with a focus on WordPress development but over the course of about six months or so I transitioned to also developing Drupal sites. I was a bit reluctant at first but this new knowledge made me a better WordPress developer and added another CMS to my toolkit which I greatly value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="6" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;&lt;div style="padding:8px;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/h26JtrvlKl/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank"&gt;Late night at work bending Drupal to my will. Last one before 4 weeks off.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;A photo posted by Mischa Colley (@mischacolley) on &lt;time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2013-12-13T10:10:09+00:00"&gt;Dec 13, 2013 at 2:10am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of my time at Orange was also spent with a focus on building responsive sites and improving workflows surrounding those type of projects. I'd been doing responsive stuff for quite a while and I was very passionate about it and sharing my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my time at Orange I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built sites both large and small. I worked on large custom WordPress sites for Government, large Drupal sites for schools, small sites, medium sites, old sites, new sites and landing pages and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built numerous e-commerce sites in both WordPress and Drupal working with things like Jigoshop, WooCommerce and Drupal Commerce and Ubercart. This work involved theming, custom development, product entry, gateway integration and testing etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many of the sites I arranged quotes on hosting, did the server provisioning and initial live deployment among other server administration tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tasks included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SEO development and Analytics / GWT setup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On and off site client training sessions with individuals and teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On and off site client meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assisting with development quotes for the sales team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mentoring junior developers and interns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team meetings &amp;amp; training presentations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with remote staff&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Together with some of the other devs I helped establish GIT as part of our development workflow along with championing the adoption of Sass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of my love for tooling and everything new and shiny in our industry I was able to transition the whole team to tools like Trello and Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-billboard-place"&gt;The Billboard Place&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1" src="billboard.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started we were located on the corner of Upper Roma and Milton Road and were better known, at least to all my friends, as &lt;em&gt;"The Billboard"&lt;/em&gt; place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Billboard place was fun but it quickly got a little cramped as we started to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was here that I began working more and more with my new &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt; Drupal. Drupal and I spent a lot of late nights together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-valley-office"&gt;The Valley Office&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I'd been with Orange about a year when we moved to the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/orange+digital/@-27.4565756,153.0343612,3a,75y,306.34h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sq_bDpJ40HH0AAAQo8DNcBg!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xb27f817982a90d69?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwinm4S71N_KAhUMJJQKHTxFBEsQoB8IazAN"&gt;Valley Office&lt;/a&gt;. This was a major upgrade to a much nicer open plan space that had been custom renovated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="6" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;&lt;div style="padding:8px;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/mxPrL6PlGX/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank"&gt;Waiting on the back steps of our new office for the big reveal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;A photo posted by Mischa Colley (@mischacolley) on &lt;time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2014-04-14T11:59:45+00:00"&gt;Apr 14, 2014 at 4:59am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were all pretty excited because among other things we could now come to the office and get breakfast every morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move saw us take on many more bigger and better clients and a number of new people joined the team. I found myself teaching more junior devs and throwing myself into larger and more complex projects where I was testing my knowledge and skill and happily finding that mostly I now really knew my stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="thinkdo---the-brains-of-orange-digital"&gt;ThinkDo - The Brains of Orange Digital&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the majority of the time I was at Orange Digital I spent 1 day a week in our innovation office &lt;a href="http://thinkdo.com.au/"&gt;ThinkDo&lt;/a&gt;, working on internal projects. I worked on three different projects during that time. We learned a lot and lots of those lessons have gone into inventing, building and delivering disruptive business innovations for Orange clients. The lessons I learned during ThinkDo time are serving me well today, including how important discovery and down-time time is for staying sharp in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id="nodunno"&gt;1 - Nodunno&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nodunno is an iOS App we developed over about a year. It is still available for &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/nodunno/id795605504?mt=8"&gt;download on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; but I don't believe it has had an update in a while. The basic premise was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Making a decision can be so hard right? With Nodunno, itâs easy. You pick three options (text or pics) and send it to your buddies. Once they tap on your question, it shows the three options and they only have a few seconds to pick one. You get a guaranteed response, every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a team of 5-6 split between, design, dev and marketing. I built the promotional website and did Front-End work on the iOS app. They marketing guys and girls had a lot of fun doing promotional videos and other things for the project. Like this one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="responsive" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdbcW9kMRYM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this slightly more tasteful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="responsive" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/90093944" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot on this team about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing and submitting apps to the App Store&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building effective landing pages and Facebook apps to drive campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marketing and SEO dos and donts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately our biggest lesson was that you need to launch quickly and fail fast. We learned our lesson for the next two projects and went to the other extreme. Taking a product to market in just 3 days with only 3 people per team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="knowenough"&gt;2 - #Knowenough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt, Tom and I took our idea in a more serous "improve the world" direction this time. We developed the concept for an "Enlightened" fashion product. We launched a &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; campaign for it and raised a couple of hundred bucks but ultimately our project wasn't chosen to continue internally and we didn't reach our funding goal. I took away a lot from this project about how Kickstarter works and how simple is best. There isn't much online to show for the project anymore but here is a video we made about it for the Kickstarter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="responsive" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjDk42vH2HM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team that did win this round of innovation built &lt;a href="http://thecoffeepost.com.au/"&gt;The Coffee Post&lt;/a&gt; which I believe is still an operating business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bitwally"&gt;3 - 1BitWally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our next round Matt, Tom and I took it pretty easy and had a lot of fun. We created a stupid little web game where you had to find a hidden pixel on the screen. If you clicked it you got to leave a message on the wall of the site. It quickly turned into an obscene mess but it was fun while it lasted. On the surface it appeared hard to solve but if you knew anything about html or just even used your tab key you could solve it in about 2 seconds (until we made some edits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short we somehow got a lot of traffic from Reddit, had a new submission at least ever second and crashed our server 3+ times, got the site "hacked", had people un-hack it for us â¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure exactly what we learn't from this project. The Internet is crazy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly 1bitwally is no longer online but you can get a feel for it's &lt;em&gt;brilliance&lt;/em&gt; thanks to the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509204942/http://1bitwally.com/"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. Have a listen to the track below (we had it auto playing in the background ) as you view it and imagine a new message appearing almost every second across the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/58976109&amp;amp;color=ff5500" class="soundcloud"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learn't a lot both personally and professional in my time at Orange and ThinkDo. I left in 2014 to spend time with my newborn son Finn and move our family back to Byron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I left Orange, the ThinkDo teams have continued to do wonderful things like &lt;a href="http://www.sendyourfriendapenisdrawing.com/"&gt;sendyourfriendapenisdrawing.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I was fortunate enough to be one of the lucky attendees at &lt;strong&gt;TEDxBrisbane 2011&lt;/strong&gt;. All the speakers were amazing, some resonated with me more than others, but everyone had something valuable to offer. Even Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a group we revisited Steve Jobs' Stanford Commencement Speech and to me it seemed very appropriate to pay tribute to a man who meant a great deal to many of the people in the room. As it did many years ago, his speech once again had a profound impact on me. An impact which continued to grow over the day and into the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="responsive" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/D1R-jKKp3NA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Here we see Steve Jobs delivering his commencement speech to the graduates of Stanford University in 2005. In it he talks about getting fired from Apple in 1985, life &amp;amp; death and a bunch of things between.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="reflections-on-tedx-brisbane-2011"&gt;Reflections on TEDx Brisbane 2011&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is a list of the presentations given at the event and some reflections on how they influenced me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I walked into &lt;strong&gt;TEDx&lt;/strong&gt; an active full-time student and walked out planning to dropping out of Uni to work on my own projects and set out on a traveling adventure with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year the &lt;strong&gt;TEDx Brisbane&lt;/strong&gt; theme was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And all you need is â¦â¦ to Connect.&lt;/em&gt;
                                        To be Open.
                                        Hope.
                                        Change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two presentations that had the most impact on me where &lt;em&gt;Edward Harran&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jeff Waldman&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="edward-harran"&gt;Edward Harran&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward Harran's presentation was a strange and quirky stream of consciousness that I found myself smiling at and nodding along to everything he said. He described so many thoughts and feelings that I was having trouble &lt;em&gt;âarticulatingâ&lt;/em&gt; and when I heard him start talking about &lt;em&gt;nomadic knowledge workers&lt;/em&gt;, creative &lt;em&gt;Basecamps&lt;/em&gt; and what he referred to as the &lt;em&gt;"inner Internet"&lt;/em&gt; I got really excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="responsive" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RBXTPPDjvIE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Edward Harran shares his story into the 'knowmad' movement: an emerging generation that has the capacity to work, learn, move, and play - with anybody, anytime, and anywhere. In his energetic talk, Edward gives us a compelling case to what is coming and highlights what the knowmads may represent: the beginning of the next renaissance.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I latter tracked down Kundavi, which he talked about in his presentation, I got even more excited. Kundavi is building a global hub for creativity and innovation in Los Cabos, Mexico which is the realisation of some ideas I have had for ages. When finished the center at Los Cabos will be sort of like a super charged version of &lt;a href="http://edgeqld.org.au/"&gt;The Edge&lt;/a&gt; and very much like an idea of mine which I have taken to calling an Open Learning Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="jeff-waldman"&gt;Jeff Waldman&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Jeff Waldman is 29 and uses his self-proclaimed love of "projects" as validation for a constantly shifting job title and set of interests that can best be described as eclectic. His hobbies include writing on dated navigation techniques, falconry, electromagnet experimentation, emulating Ernest Hemingway, studying time travel and carpentry, in that order. Heâs been invited to speak at 3 TEDx events, awarded 2 Awesome Foundation Grants and secured $11k in funding via Kickstarter to continue his work in Bolivia. All for the simplistic act of illicitly installing public swings. And yes, heâs as surprised by this as you are."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just love this idea! How cool to be able to do good fulfilling work with something as simple as hanging a swing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="responsive" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mJIgAWu_MJ8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-after-party"&gt;The After Party?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I would have liked to stay and talk I left early and skipped the drinks. Trying to be alcohol free I knew I couldn't resist a free drink if I stayed. I got home from the conference early, started telling my wife Sandra about the day and promptly welled up with tears. Not really out of sadness but more out of stress release and some intellectual, spiritual and emotional overload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got home from the conference with a lot on my mind. You see there have been a lot of things weighing on my for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm constantly frustrated with how uninspiring and downright disappointing most of my learning experience at Uni are.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have so many interests that I find it hard to focus on any one thing. I am never bored but often scatty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to travel but feel the pressure to establish a career path.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love music but really haven't played for ages due to my focus on building a career as a Designer, Developer and Entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife is ready to have a baby and I am not yet ready for various reasons related to the above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you can see there is a bit on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to summaries my feelings its:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If all you need is to Connect then Uni really hasn't been doing it for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If all you need is to be Open then uni has landed me flat out of luck there too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have barely spent anytime on campus this semester except for my activities as Marketing Director of ITSA and Founder and co-host of the QUT Web Design Meetup which are the only activities that give me Hope and offer the potential for Change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some #TEDxBrisbane comments on Twitter struck a chord with me and it was people talking about how there was a lot of great ideas and energy but considerable less action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2012 my wife Sandra was planing on starting her own Family Day Care business and I was going to kick it to a new level and final start taking more clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Sandra and I talked about this that night we realised we where both locking ourselves into more responsibility then we actually wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we both unanimously decided we would change our plans it felt like a giant weight had lifted from my shoulders and I could breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first thing in ages that I could point to something and say &lt;a href="http://bjeanes.com/2011/07/hell-yes"&gt;HELL YES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am not going to settle and I am going to stay hungry and stay foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I spent two years living in Germany and traveled Europe I still have a hunger to see more of the world and experience other places. When I returned from Germany intent on studying I was full of purpose and clarity. I was very aware that my chosen course would not address all my personal interests, however I felt confident that it would provide a solid foundation which self-directed study could compliment. I was wrong. The last two years of uni have robed me of my clarity and direction and I want it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important thing that I have come to realise over the last few months, and that Edward Harran finally helped me âarticulateâ, is that it is ok to be âundefinedâ. Its ok to have a lot of interests and as Paul Boag points out, there are ways to still be successful as a generalist. It turns out I am not the only one who has a billion interests and cannot focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Another thing is it is ok to âfailâ. Upon completing this semester at QUT I found I had failed a unit. I have never failed at anything in my life not least of which something I am actually interested in. I see failure as a warning sign that something isnât right and it's time to make a &lt;strong&gt;change&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Acknowledging that âmaking a differenceâ through political activism, is what consistently makes me happy doesnât deny my pleasures in motherhood and cooking. I get a long term buzz from being a political activist. From student politics in the fifties when we took over another group, through seventies feminism and broader political activism, there were many rushes of pleasure that came from my being responsible for making social changes.&lt;/p&gt;

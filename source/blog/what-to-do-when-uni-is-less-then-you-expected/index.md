I have always been one to expect a lot. Dad always tells me that I shouldn’t waste time on things I can’t change. I’ve always had a problem with that. 

When I commenced my study at QUT in 2010 it was after a solid break from formal study. I did a two year gap year. Traveled, got married, you know the usual. I was very psyched to get into my studies. 

Unfortunately I was very under-whelmed. The first IT lecture I attended was appalling. I couldn’t believe this was going to be the memory of my first lecture I would carry with me for the rest of my life. The worst of my high school teachers would have put this guy to shame. Lectures kept repeating the phrase *“uni is not like school, its going to be a lot harder”*. What about all the mature age students, not everyone is just out of school? 

Luckily I am not one to give up easily. I got talking to a lot of people about their first year experience and found many felt just like me. 

I spent time on forums, joined free or cheap online courses and I dove into learning anything and everything I could about web design & development. 

On of the things I am most greatful about my school days is that my school and my family taught me how to learn.

So if your feeling under-whelmed or worried your degree isn’t cutting it or its not training you in everything you need. As the saying goes. Accept the things you can’t change; have the courage to change the things you can; and the wisdom to know the difference. Don’t blame the University. Get out there and do something about it.

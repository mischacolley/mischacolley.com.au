In October Sandra had two weeks off from work and study so along with her sister Meike and Meik's boyfriend Sven we headed to Denmark for two weeks. We rented a nice little house nestled in amongst the windblown Danish sand dunes. 

We got up early in the dark freezing cold and drove for about 4 hours till we reached a small fishing/tourist town called [Hvide Sande](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hvide_Sande). We had to wait around a few hours for the key so we had a bit of a look around the place. 

The most interesting thing for me was we found an old WWII bunker in the middle of the town....was pretty strange after reading lots of WWII history and than all of a sudden be standing on a real live bunker. 

This one never saw any fighting though .... must have been pretty bloody cold, lonely and boring for the poor young soldiers which had to stay there. 

The part of Denmark we where in is pretty cool country.....just all rolling sand dunes as far as the eye can see....thatched and new black roofed house (black to keep the heat in) nestled in amongst them and the whole country side is littered by flag polls flying the red an white Danish flag...... very patriotic. 

I can see why though because that stretch of coast is a German holiday area and the whole time we where there we didn't come across anyone who didn't speak German.....if they weren't German themselves. That was the only thing that was not so good for me because it didn't really feel like being in another country. 

The beach was cool......not even close to how nice Byron Bay is but it was cool to be looking out on the North Sea. The beach also had 8-12 bunkers in varying states of decay strewn along the beach....they are massive concert monstrosities. We had a fun day exploring them but it is kind of sad to see them there too. 

Could talk about Denmark more an I probably have more stories but some of you have already heard them i.e.

the one about me an Sandra walking out of a supermarket with a cartoon of beer we somehow managed not to pay for. I enjoyed that beer very much! So I will continue with the rest otherwise we will be here forever. Write an ask me if you want to no more an let me no what you&rsquo;ve been up to.

# Back to HH

On the way back into Hamburg we hit a major traffic jam .... 18km of none moving cars an so a journey that was meant to take roughly 4 hours took near on 8. 

We got out the map an Meike did some nice lane changes an than we hit the countryside and back roads but it didn't make the journey any faster .... at least we weren't sitting still though. 

# Herbst

On arrival back in Hamburg it was pretty amazing because in two weeks the trees had turned from there normal green to almost full *herbst* colors.....dropping there leaves etc.....an it was noticeable fucking colder. 

Anyway a few weeks past as usual ..... Sandra really busy with work an study an me not doing that much....a bit of babysitting, English teaching an a German course two days a week.

# It's a Ruddslide
Than the amazing fantastic result of the election back home.....fantastic! Than mum arrived on the 25th of November. Me an Sandra an her dad Hanz picked her up from the Hamburg airport an than we went back to Sandra's parents place for lunch. 

We had a nice afternoon an evening an than mum had to sleep so I tucked her into her bed in the spare room an than me an Sandra got the bus home......the next couple of days I showed mum around where we live an our house.....taught her how to catch the bus's an made her speak her first bit of German to get her bus ticket. *"Eine targeskarte bitte"*, which means *"one day ticket please"*. I took her into the city and we went and saw an exhibition of the Chinese Terracotta Warriors which was cool. 

Than on the Friday me an mum went out to the kindy where Sandra works to see a Christmas performance by the kids......was interesting to see a Steiner performance here. Than we went straight to the Hamburg Dome in the inner city which is a big carnival/show that is in the city 3 times a year. That was a lot of fun... ate some good food etc an than we walked down the Kiez (massive nightlife....clubs, strip-clubs etc) and into St. Puli (more strip-clubs an prostitutes an adult shops) an the beginning of the famous Reperbahn (red-light district). Sanda kept a tight hold of me so we wouldn't get mobbed by the countless prostitutes on the streets.....an even than they still sometimes try......kind of sad really. An its got nothing to do with how you look, they seam to go for anyone. 

The next day we hit the Harbor an went on a ferry ride an than had an "interesting" dinner at a German Sushi restaurant..... interesting!

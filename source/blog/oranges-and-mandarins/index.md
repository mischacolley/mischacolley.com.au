In early 2013 I interviewed at Orange Digital and soon after began working there part time. Sandra and I were recently back from 4.5 months in Europe and I was struggling to get myself reengaged with uni. If you remember I all but decided I was dropping out when we left to go traveling. 

Part time quickly turned to full time and then I never enrolled for my next semester. For the past 18 months I've been working as a Developer at Orange Digital and what an action packed 18 months it has been. 

## The Billboard Place

When I started we were located on the corner of Upper Roma and Milton Road and were better known, at least to all my friends, as *"The Billboard"* place. 

I've built a lot of websites and learnt a lot about myself as a developer.

          I help purposeful organisations with digital technology.
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          I've worked in digital for more than a decade, as both a Developer and
          CTO.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          Becoming a dad made it really clear to me that if I was to remain in
          tech then it would have to be exclusively working on purposeful
          projects. So that's what I do. My two kids (8 & 10), and the world I
          want for them, provide the filter for the type of projects I chose to
          work on.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-5">
          Over the last few years I've been working with my own NFP, Social
          Enterprises and B Corp clients, as well as collaborating on projects
          with values aligned businesses like Populares, Digital Village,
          StartSomeGood, Verve Super,Rainbow Power Company, We are Explorers and
          Today.

          Recently someone referred to me as a Swiss Army knife â€” an adaptable,
          multi-skilled problem solver, ready for anything. Being a proud
          generalist I took it as the highest compliment :)
        </p>

        <h2 id="what" className="font-sans font-bold text-2xl mb-5">
          Here are some of the things I can help you with:

        <ul className="text-lg mb-5">
          <li className="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
            <strong>A development project</strong> - Where I leverage my skills
            and experience as a developer and help you build/ update websites
            and apps. Either on my own, using my generalist developer skills, or
            as part of a team where I'll zero in on the frontend
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
            <strong>Technical leadership</strong> - Can't afford a full time
            CTO? Hire me as a fractional CTO and I can help you translate the
            technical into something tangible and get what you need done
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
            <strong>Digital strategy</strong> - Where I lead a discovery
            workshop that may become a digital transformation project capable of
            impacting your whole organisation. I'll consult AND I'll implement
            as well if I'm the right person for the job

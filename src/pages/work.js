          I help purposeful organisations with digital technology.
        </h1>

        <p>
          Iâ€™ve worked in digital for more than a decade, as both a front of the frontend Developer and CTO.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the last few years I've been <s>freelancing</s> experementing with creating <em>not another digital agency</em>. Along with working with my own clients, i've compleated a series of collaborative projects with values aligned businesses like Today, Populares and most recently Digital Village.
        </p>

        <h2 id="what">
          Here are some of the things I can help you with:
        </h2>

        <ul>
          <li>A development project - Where I leverage my skills and expereince as a frontend developer and help you build/ update websites and apps. Either on my own, or as part of a team</li>
          <li>Technical leadership - Can't afford a full time CTO? On-demand I can help you translate the technical into something tangabile you can work with</li>
          <li>Digital strategy - Where I lead a discovery workshop that may become a digital transformation project capable of impacting your whole organisation</li>
        </ul>
